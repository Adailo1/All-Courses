"Right here in this repository, I'll commit all the projects and exercises that I did in any course. I'll do this to keep this section just for courses and tutorials, while keeping my personal projects, which I'm doing alone, in other repositories. This way, I can assess my level of competence without using any courses or tutorials to complete a project."
